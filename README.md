# Software-Sales-Analysis-Atliq Hardware(PowerBI Dashboard)

##  Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard was developed for Atliq Hardware to transform their sales data analysis from manual Excel-based processes into an automated and interactive business intelligence solution.
The goal was to provide the Sales Manager with real-time insights into top customers, products, regional performance, profit trends, and weak sales areas — all in one place.
This solution helps guide critical business decisions such as optimizing product focus, pricing strategies, and regional sales efforts.

##  1. Business Problem

**The Challenge:**
The Sales Manager at Atliq Hardware was facing major difficulties in analyzing sales performance due to data being scattered across multiple Excel sheets. This fragmented approach made it hard to:

- Quickly identify top-performing customers and best-selling products.
- Compare regional performance across cities and zones.
- Detect underperforming products and analyze reasons for low sales.
- Make real-time, data-driven decisions for strategic planning.

**The Pain Points:**
- Manual data consolidation was time-consuming and error-prone.
- No real-time insights to support agile business responses.
- Difficult to spot patterns and trends across time, products, and regions.
- Limited visibility into profit margins and customer profitability metrics.
